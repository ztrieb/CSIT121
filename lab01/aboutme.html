             I am currently in my final class prior to obtaining my Associate's Degree 
             in Information Technology. I am a returning student after a 9 year break.
             My current goal is to transfer to a four year University, and obtain a 
             Bachelor's Degree in Human Resources.

                Coffee is my passion, and I can make a mean latte. I love to run,
                and I try to do at least 5 running events year (from 5ks to 12 milers).
