    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>This is a photo taken of me at the Moonlight 5K in Bel Air, MD in July this year.</p>
    <h2>Why did I choose this JPG?</h2>
    <p>Running has become a new hobby for me in the last two years. I've always struggled with my weight since childhood. These last two years have been the best I've felt about my body in the longest time. This is mostly thanks to all of the running events I have been doing, which has promoted more of a healthly lifestyle for me.</p>

    <p>My current goal is to completely fill up the medal holder in my room.</p>
